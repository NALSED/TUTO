# Interview Pitch - Junior Infrastructure Engineer

Hello,

I’m originally from France and I moved to Armenia with my family about a year ago.

Before, I worked as a carpenter, but after a serious knee injury, I decided to change careers and follow something I’ve always been interested in — IT and system administration.

I completed a training program where I built a full test infrastructure, including Active Directory, GPO, DNS and DHCP redundancy, WSUS, VPN setup with pfSense, FreePBX connected to AD, and ticketing with GLPI.

At home, I also manage my own small lab: I use a Raspberry Pi with Pi-hole, a backup server with RAID and LVM, Docker with SSL certificates, and I recently started learning Python to improve automation skills.

This is my first job interview in IT, but I’m highly motivated, a fast learner, and I really want to grow in this field. I see this position at EGS as a great opportunity to start my career in a real professional environment.
