# Interview Pitch - Junior Infrastructure Engineer

Hello,

I’m originally from France and moved to Armenia with my family about a year ago.
My wife works at the French high school in Yerevan, and our two children go to school there.

Before, I worked as a carpenter, but after a serious accident where I broke both of my knees, I decided to change careers and pursue a field I have always been passionate about — IT and system administration.

This is my first job interview in IT, but I am highly motivated, a fast learner, and eager to grow in this field. I see this position at EGS as a great opportunity to start my professional career.

I understand that the banking sector demands very high standards in security, data protection, and service availability. I am eager to learn more about the specific regulations and challenges in the financial industry to ensure reliable and secure IT services.

I completed a training program where I built a full test infrastructure, including Active Directory, GPO, DNS and DHCP redundancy, WSUS, VPN setup with pfSense, FreePBX integrated with AD, and ticketing with GLPI.

At home, I manage a small personal lab as well: I use a Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole, a backup server with RAID and LVM, Docker containers secured with SSL certificates, and I recently started learning Python to improve my automation skills.
